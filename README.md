Project overview 
This is a simple chatbot built with Flask that handles customer support inquiries using predefined keywords and responses. It interprets user inputs to respond appropriately based on specific topics like order status, product information, troubleshooting, and returns. Using session management, the bot also tracks if the user is in the process of returning an item and requests further details as needed
The frontend, built in HTML with JavaScript, provides a user interface where users can interact with the chatbot, with messages dynamically appearing as the conversation progresses.
